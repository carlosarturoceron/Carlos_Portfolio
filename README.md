Hi! Here you can find the projects that I've been working trought my journey as an Odds/Kid. Yes, as you might have noticed, I am passionate about the DataScience world, but more so about decision making under uncertainty, about odds (probability), and the different methods to quatinfy uncertainty.

Data Science Portfolio

## [Project 1: Survey Monkey Database](https://github.com/carlosarturoceron/Survey_Monkey)
The client has collected demographic and employment data trough a survey, with multiple questions and subquestions, each question can have multiple answers. Client provides raw data and requirements for desired format, client needs to count how many people answered each question and how many gave the same answer. Original dataset is 198x100, final dataset is 17028x10.

### Skills and Tools
Data Manipulation, Joint, Merge, Groupby, Pandas

## [Project 2: FoodHub Data Analysis](https://github.com/carlosarturoceron/Foodhub_Project)
The food aggregator company has stored the data of the different orders made by the registered customers in their online portal. They want to analyze the data to draw some actionable insights for the business. Perform the data analysis to find answers to these questions that will help the company to improve the business.

### Skills and Tools
Exploratory Data Analysis (Variable Identification, Univariate analysis, Bi-Variate analysis), Python

## [Project 3: Business Statistics: E-news Express](https://github.com/carlosarturoceron/ENews_Express_Project)
This project used statistical analysis, a/b testing, and visualization to decide whether the new landing page of an online news portal (E-news Express) is effective enough to gather new subscribers or not. The simulated dataset has certain important metrics such as converted status and time spent on the page that will help to conclude the effectiveness of the new landing page. Apart from that, the dependence of conversion on the preferred language will also be analyzed in this project.

The sample standard deviation of the time spent on the new page is: 1.82 min.

The sample standard deviation of the time spent on the old page is: 2.58 min.

In order to compate the means from 2 independent populations when standard deviations are unknown we wiil use a 2-sample-independent t-test. A
As the p-value 0.000139 is less than the level of significance, we reject the null hypothesis. We have enough statistical data to support that the time spent by users in the new page is not equal to the old page. In fact, it is higher in the new page!
